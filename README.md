âœ¨ I'm a backend developer and a DevOps engineer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at MDinc, a medtech startup.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Lua for writing NeoVim plugins and Ansible for better configuration management!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @Jorres on Telegram

I am passionate about programming as a hobby: I've scripted my whole working environment with Lua, I'm playing Screeps - a
strategy game for programmers, and I'm sponsoring Open Source!

I'm also finishing bachelor's degree at ITMO University in a few months which will open up a whole world of possibilities!
